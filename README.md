## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently working on a React webapp to compare pricing in grocery stores in Canada, and multiple full-stack projects like a [climbing weather app](https://github.com/OlegVasiliev89/Climbing-Weather) and a [weather API accuracy tracker](https://github.com/OlegVasiliev89/Weather-API-accuracy) using Flask and Supabase.

Try my Outdoor climbing WebApp [here](http://climbing-weather.oleg-vasiliev.com/) to find the best crag this weekend.
Try the Weather APIs Tracker WebApp [here](http://weather-api-accuracy.oleg-vasiliev.com/), to determine the best weather API for your next project.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced my programming skills, and improving my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner to intermediate web projects, especially anything involving Vue.js, Flask, or APIs, and Iâ€™d love to pair program or debug together!
