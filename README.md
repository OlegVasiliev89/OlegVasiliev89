## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-Iâ€™m currently working on a Vue.js portfolio website and multiple beginner-friendly full-stack projects like a climbing weather app and a weather API accuracy tracker using Flask and Supabase.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced JavaScript concepts, and improving my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on beginner-to-intermediate web projects, especially anything involving Vue.js, Flask, or APIs â€” and Iâ€™d love to pair program or debug together!
